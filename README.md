# GeoTaggedAudio app for Android

This application records and playbacks audio with geographic coordinates attached to corresponding instances of the sound. 
While recording, the app grabs the current location from GPS or Network and saves it in a separate file. 
During playback, the path of the recording is drawn on the map, and the approximate location at the current time of the audio is marked on the map.

## Distribution
The app can be downloaded on Google Play Market [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ahmetkizilay.audio.geotag "Link").
